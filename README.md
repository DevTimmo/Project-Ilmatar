ERPG for RPG Research

RPG Research will create through three phases of development a solo and multiplayer compatible adventure that furthers the vision and mission statements of the organization and helps train our volunteer staff to use ERPGs to achieve these goals.

We are looking to create the following:
Platform that allows solo and multiplayer adventures
Built in some kind of open source license that mandates attribution and does allow commercial use with permission. 
Development tools must allow this kind of use
Public download use 
Run on as many platforms as possible (starting with PC)

Our purpose is to make it easy to create adventures for specific targeted goals in recreation, entertainment, education, and therapy
